As part of my undergraduate degree, I am working on a final year project I have called &amp;ldquo;FediUni&amp;rdquo;. The documentation for this project will be hosted at https://docs.fediuni.xyz.
The project proposes to build an ActivityPub service targeted specifically at third level students. The idea is that any society or club could deploy their own instance of the FediUni service such that they can interact with members at a local level or with other societies at a higher level.</description></item></channel></rss>
